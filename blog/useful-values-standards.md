# Useful Values and Standards

Duncan Mc kean made a useful post on his blog about common poster sizes and a reference table of their 300DPI pixel sizes.

I’d like to follow that up by making this page a library of useful standards and values for myself and fellow 3D artist etc.

### Focal Lenghth

Trying to match your 3D camera to a reference image or just find the right look for your scene? This is a list of common focal lengths used in the real world.

| Prime Lens / Fixed Focal Length      |
| ---------------|---------------------|
| Ultra-Wide     | 18mm, 20mm          |
| Wide           | 24mm, 28mm, 35mm    |
| Standard       | 50mm                |
| Short Telephoto| 85mm                |
| Telephoto      | 105mm, 135mm        |
| Super Telephoto| 200mm, 300mm, 400mm |

35mm and 50mm are always safe bets. 50mm is personally my favorite lens for portraits.

| Zoom Lens / Variable Focal Length |
| -----------------|----------------|
| Ultra-Wide       | 10-15mm        |
| Wide             | 15-28mm        |
| Standard         | 28-40mm        |
| Short Telephoto  | 40-60mm        |
| Medium Telephoto | 60-135mm       |
| Long Telephoto   | 135-300mm      |
| Super Telephoto  | <300mm         |

### F/Stop

If your rendering with depth of field then these commonly used f/stop values are a useful starting point for finding the best settings.

*(lower values = shorter depth of field)*

|F/Stop|
|----  |
| 22 |
| 16 |
| 11 |
| 8.0|
| 5.6|
| 4.0|
| 2.8|
| 2.0|
| 1.4|

#### Other useful aspect ratios
- Paper (A series) - 1.14:1
- IMAX - 1.43:1
- Analogue 35mm film - 3:2
- European widescreen – 5:3
- US widescreen – 1.85:1
- Current widescreen cinema standard – 2.35:1

### Video Codecs & Containers

Codecs and containers can be a fairly complex subject. I'm not going to make a full list but here are my go to options.

- h.264 with Mp4 or MKV *(MP4 has slightly better support than MKV)*
- WebM  if you’d like an open source option.

### Useful IOR Values

I just picked out a few common ones, if you need more there’s a much more extensive list [here](http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=513458).

|Material|IOR|
|---
|Aluminium | 1.44
|Asphalt | 1.635
|Bronze | 1.18
|Copper | 1.10
|Diamond | 2.417
|Glass (average) | 1.51714
|Gold | 0.47
|Nylon | 1.53
|Silver | 0.18
|Steel | 2.50
|Water (room temp) | 1.33157

### What else?

This isn’t by any means an exhaustive list, I’m just getting started. I need *your* help to expand this page with things that are useful to all of us.

So… what have I missed?
